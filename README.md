## Abstract
Adapted from https://github.com/ehoogeboom/multinomial_diffusion

## Instructions
In the folder containing `setup.py`, run
```
pip install --user -e .
```
The `--user` option ensures the library will only be installed for your user.
The `-e` option makes it possible to modify the library, and modifications will be loaded on the fly.

You should now be able to use it.


## Running experiments.

Go to the folder bandit_diffusion and follow the readme instructions there.
